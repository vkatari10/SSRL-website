        <p>A new venture developed by the UGA SSRL giving high-school students opportunites to work with CubeSat technology</p>

        <p>Purpose: Overcome hurdles of cost and technical requiements to entering CubeSat research</p>

        <p>This program allows high-school students to create payloads housed in satellite payloads developed by the UGA SSRL given to students as LEARNSat kits consisitng of satelitte bus and education content required to assemble it </p>

        <p>Launched using weather balloons, this suboritmal mission will reduce exorbitant launch costs as well as reducing compatability with NASA's stringent tecnical requirements, making the process easier for high school students.</p>

to, which would otherwise be hard for high school students to meet.
LEARNSat-1 will be an internal mission so that we can map out all the
requirements and face logistical problems first before we invite high schools to
participate. This would allow for more STEM students in UGA to be involved in
CubeSat development and raise awareness of satellite technology in schools.
Additionally, as part of the funding we also have $2000 allocated to hosting a
competition for high schools to compete in with their research proposals, with
the best one being selected and given the funding to start developing their
project.
