        <p>Developed by the UGA SSRL, this reperesents a new venture giving high-school students opportunites to work with CubeSat technology</p>

        <p>Purpose: Overcome hurdles of cost and technical requiements to entering CubeSat research</p>
        <p>Allows students to break into CubeSat reserach</p>
        <p>Cost, technical requirement</p>

        <p>This program allows high-school students to create payloads housed in satellite payloads developed by the UGA SSRL given to students as LEARNSat kits consisitng of satelitte bus and education content required to assemble it </p>

        <p>Launched using weather balloons, this suboritmal mission will reduce exorbitant launch costs as well as reducing compatability with NASA's stringent tecnical requirements, making the process easier for high school students.</p>

to, which would otherwise be hard for high school students to meet.
LEARNSat-1 will be an internal mission so that we can map out all the
requirements and face logistical problems first before we invite high schools to
participate. This would allow for more STEM students in UGA to be involved in
CubeSat development and raise awareness of satellite technology in schools.
Additionally, as part of the funding we also have $2000 allocated to hosting a
competition for high schools to compete in with their research proposals, with
the best one being selected and given the funding to start developing their
project.

Current Target Customer: STEM-focused K-12 Educational Institutes (with
emphasis on magnet and private schools)

<!--
Build a basic website from scratch to advertise our newest mission, the LEARNSat program, using the tools of your own choosing.
We are not looking for a full-fledged website, but the purpose of this project is to challenge you with a large volume of work within 
a short period. We will be looking for functionality, technical expertise, creativity, and your ability to interpret information and 
display it effectively.

ADVERTISE the newest mission
LOOKING FOR functionality, techincal expertise, creativity, and the ability for me to interpret information and display it effectivley

I DO NOT have to display all the information I have the freedom to make creative assumptions and make changes to augment the website
 
Feel free to attach mock-ups and ideas along with your final project, but make sure to clarify which are which. Upon completion, 
please reply to this email with your final project, along with a description of what tools you used, no later than September 16th at 11:59 pm.
