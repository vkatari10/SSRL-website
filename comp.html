            <p>Through dedicated funding, resources have been allocated to host a nationwide competition for high schools, inviting students to submit detailed research proposals focused on scientific or engineering topics. This competition is designed to encourage creativity, critical thinking, and innovation among high school students, offering them a platform to showcase their ideas and potential solutions to real-world challenges. Schools from across the country are encouraged to participate, and students work together to develop well-researched, compelling proposals. The winning teams are awarded $2,000, which can be used to fund the development and implementation of their proposed projects. This funding not only provides financial support but also serves as a motivating factor for students to turn their concepts into reality, whether they are building prototypes, conducting experiments, or advancing their research. Ultimately, the competition aims to inspire young minds to pursue STEM fields and contribute to the advancement of technology and science at an early age.</p>
